        <p class="center pinkText ">Hello all, I am a student taking a break from classes to join this program in hopes to be a head of my graduating class! I also hope to learn a new perspective from my peers and instructor/TAs as this will make me a stronger and more competitive candidate for future job roles!
            I'm From Seattle, Washington, USA. My favorite hobby is researching or learning new facts from google, youtube, or reddit
            My dream is to work for a company that treats their employees well with an amazing salary I can easily raise a family with ^-^
            I want to be a web developer because I believe that this will a fun career pathway that will never leave me bored, I also simply want to understand how the entire process of web development works. I also hope that one day I can volunteer my knowledge to be part of real change in the world (one day)!</p>
